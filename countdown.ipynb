    "The Countdown numbers Game is a popular televised gameshow game, this notebook is a replication of the technical and logical side of countdown numbers game. The countdown numbers game involves a board of 24 numbered cards, arranged faced down. The top row contains the large numbers which are 25, 50, 75, 100. The three other rows contain cards with small numbers between 1 and 10 inclusive. A contestant most chose six cards from the 24 cards available to them, the contestant has the option to choose the amount of \"large\" or \"small\" numbered cards, for example they could chose 1 large numbered card and 5 small numbered cards (75, 3, 2, 1, 7, 4). Once the 6 cards are chosen by the contestant, a random 3-digit number is generated called the target number, the target can range from 101 to 999. The contestant has 30 seconds to use the 6 numbers they chose to make the target number or as near as possible.    \n",

    "The Countdown Numbers Game in this notebook follows the rules that exist in the original countdown numbers game. However, one small change is that the six numbers the player originally was able to choose himself are randomly chosen by the computer. Other than that, the game functions just like the original and follows all rules and concepts correctly."

    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "The Countdown Numbers Game for a human might not seem to be hard to solve, but for a computer it is way more than complex as it consists of many potential results to obtain the target result. Every single number is mixed up, with every possible permutation of those numbers \"it.product(it.permutations(gameNumbers)\", with every single mathematical operator that this can happen to \"it.product(*([ops] * 5)\". Keeping in mind the order of the equation, as order matters. For example: (10 / 2) * 2 = 10 or (10 / 2) * 2 = 2.5. The second equation would be wrong as no decimals are allowed making the algorithms more complex because order of equation has to be considered. However, the Reverse Polish Notation helps the computer out.  The Reverse Polish Notation is a mathematical notation in which operators follow their operands as such: 1 1 + which is the same as 1 + 1 or 3 4 + 5 * which is the same as (3 + 4) * 5.\n",
    "\n",
    "When the 6 game numbers are mixed and 5 operators are mixed that is 6 factorial and 5 factorial of possible iterations that can be done of the numbers and operators being mixed. And then we need to mix the game numbers and operators to create a Reverse Polish Notation to be then solved to get an answer, so that’s 6 + 5 = 11, so 11 factorials. The factorial of 11 being 39,916,800, meaning there is this many iterations of the possible solution between 6 numbers and 5 operators to find the possible answer. The Plot below showcases just how much of an impact factorial has on a program compared to other mathematical functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Complexity also depends on what the target number is to be hit with what set of game numbers for example in this documentary (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cVMhkqPP2YI&t=27s) about Countdown numbers game, Dr. Alex Turner explains that the easiest target numbers to hit are 100, 102, 104, 108. And the hardest target number too hit is 947 because of it being a large prime number with it only being made by 9017 boards out of 2.155 billion.\n",
    "\n",
    "The mean and standard deviation of the time it takes to loop through each answer can be checked in the cell above by un-commenting the \"%%timeit\" command. when un-commented for the specific numbers above the answer is: 517 ms ± 5.05 ms per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 1 loop each)."

    "## Functional Programming\n",
    "\n",
    "https://docs.python.org/3/howto/functional.html\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is Functional Programming?\n",
    "Functional programming is based on producing simplistic reduced functions that focus on an argument and return value. A function in functional programming is not meant to have side effect, you give the function an input and it will return an output without modifying the inputs. This is known as a pure function where the results of the return value are dependent on the input parameter. Functional programming allows for the creation of clean and maintainable software, keeping the data side and functionality independent, avoiding changing state of variables (it’s okay to declare a new variable instead of re-using existing variables) and treating functions as first class meaning treat functions like data, where a function can be assigned to a variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Functional Aspect of Code behind Countdown Numbers Game.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Countdown game is developed in a functional programming style, following some of the functional programming principles talked above and also using some features python has available for implementing functional style programming. Below is an explanation of each principle and python feature and how they are implemented in the Countdown Numbers Game code.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Pure Functions: Functions in the countdown numbers game are developed to receive an input, process the input, and return an output, without interfering with any other parts of the games code, and without modifying the inputs. A good example of a pure function in the code is the \"generateGameNumbers\", it receives an input, process it and returns the generated numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "* State Of Variables: The game is developed to avoid state and tries to emphasize functionality of the functions. The variables are almost seen as immutable variables, that can’t be changed (or at least the goal is for them not to be changed). The state of variables does not change, and the value of the variables are passed through functions as arguments and are processed and the processed data is returned as a output. This can be seen in the \"solveCountdownNumbersGame\" function where the target and game numbers are passed in and processed and then passed into the \"patterns\" function and then a value is returned at the end. As you can see in those functions the state of the initial arguments was never changed.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Iterators Python: Python Iterator feature is used to iterate over the possible different types of equation sequences. Itertools Product and permutation are used from the itertools library. Product() finds the cartesian product of the generated numbers and operators, which then the product is used to calculate an equation to solve for the target. Permutation() takes the generated numbers and creates a list of immutable tuples that contain all permutations of the generated number in a list form. This is used in the \"solveCountdownNumbersGame\" when ordering the pairs.\n",
    "\n",
    "* First class Functions: Functions are treated like data and passed into other functions as attributes in the code this helps with keeping the code clean and helps to avoid state, in the \"solveCountdownNumbersGame\" function, the \"eval_rpn(c)\" function is passed into the \"displayCalculation\" function as an attribute to avoid creating a state, this reduces any possible negative side effects to disrupt the games flow.\n"
